# node-cpu-benchmark

This is a small cpu benchmark made just for fun to see how good our cpu's are.
It uses nw.js for some basic gui and a module I wrote in node.js for calculating prime numbers.
For prime numbers the script equally splits the work in all cpu threads.

Some info::
Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/
Nw.js https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js
Prime Numbers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number 


To Run::
You need to install node.js and nw.js from the aboves link.
After that clone the current repo and open a terminal in the folder.
Enter this command and then a window will open with all the gui to help you run the bench.
```
nw_executable_path .
```
